# Blockchain Simulator

Here, there is a client server interaction using JSON over TCP sockets. The blockchain exists on the server. 
It will be constructed there and the client will make requests for operations over a TCP socket. 
The client will be focused on driving the menu driven interaction and communicating with the server on the backend. 
If the client exits, the server will still handle new requests with the existing blockchain intact.

## Steps to run the program:
1. Run ServerTCP.java
2. Run ClientTCP.java
3. Select options from the menu and follow instructions to complete a simulation
